            <li class="wrong" onclick="wrong()">South East Asia</li>
            <li class="wrong" onclick="wrong()">Eastern Europe</li>

    <p id="blurb">Sub-Saharan Africa faces the biggest challenges in providing schools with basic resources, especially at the primary and lower secondary levels, as fewer than half of schools in Sub-Saharan Africa had access to electricity, the internet, computers and basic handwashing facilities, key basic services and facilities necessary to ensure a safe and effective learning environment for all students. In terms of teaching staff, it has the lowest percentage (64%) of primary teachers with the minimum pedagogical training according to national standards. More than half the children that have not enrolled in school live in sub-Saharan Africa, and more than 85% of children in Sub-Saharan Africa are not learning the minimum.</p>
